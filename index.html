<h4>About Me:</h4>
  <p>
    HEY! My name is Madelyn Kolterman but I go by Maddie. I was born and raised in Spokane, Washington USA, and art and design have been my passions since the day I could hold a pencil on my own. I started drawing at the ripe age of four when my Mom handed me a pen and a scrap piece of paper from the bottom of her purse during one of my older sister's basketball games to keep me distracted. I draw and sketch daily, mostly drawing portraits for practice and designing print layouts for design class at Eastern Washington University. I am a senior in the Visual Communication Design Program at EWU and will be completing my Bachelor's in Summer of 2020. I am a memeber of EWU's chapter of the National Soicety of Leadership and Success, and a Seasonal Plumbing Associate at Lowe's. I am a hard worker and put even more work into my art. Here are some examples!
